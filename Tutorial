download git for windows
download sublime text editor
install git with default settings.

configure git 

# git config --global user.name "sthaniraj"
# git config --global user.email "stha.niraj@gmail.com"

# git config --list  <see settings>

Signup an account on github.com with same email id and name
- Create a repo called mygit
- Copy the URL for mygit.

- open git bash
- go to the directory where u need to have all the repo to be in local system 

- now we gonna clone the repo we just made on github to local machine.
# git clone <URL>
# git clone https://github.com/sthaniraj/mygit.git

$ git clone https://github.com/sthaniraj/mygit.git
Cloning into 'mygit'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
Checking connectivity... done.


now u see the folder is created as mygit in the current dir.

now goto mygit folder to see if its created. yes it did.
to see which remote this repo is associated with :
# git remote
# git remote -v 

$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/sthaniraj/mygit.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sthaniraj/mygit.git (push)

the origin is just a name for the online repo ( we can change this to our simplicity)
here i will make it as mygit_origin.

$ git remote rename origin mygit_origin

$ git remote -v
mygit_origin    https://github.com/sthaniraj/mygit.git (fetch)
mygit_origin    https://github.com/sthaniraj/mygit.git (push)


i went to mygit repo online and added readme.md and commited the change.
i will now pull those new changes done online to my local machine.

# git pull mygit_origin
$ git pull mygit_origin

checking status now
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'mygit_origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        Tutorial

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

it says not being tracked. i will stage it (will be tracked.)

# git add .

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'mygit_origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   Tutorial

looks good now .. i will then commit the change. 
# git commit -m 'Added tutorial file'

$ git commit -m 'Added tuorial file'
[master 1cf7dea] Added tuorial file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 Tutorial

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'mygit_origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean


I will upload this change to mygit repo online. 
# git push mygit_origin

$ git push mygit_origin
warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

Now  i can see Tutorial file online too.

i will again edit this tutorial file save it, add to staging, commit and push it.

while pushing it gives a bogus and irritating messages, we make it simple by 
# git config --global push.default simple

Now it looks more cleaner.

$ git push mygit_origin
